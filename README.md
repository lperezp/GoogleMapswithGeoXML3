# GoogleMapswithGeoXML3
Integration of the Google Maps API using a KML file with the GeoXML library to get information about the drawn polygons.

## About GEOXML3
The geoxml3 project is an effort to develop a KML processor for use with Version 3 of the Google Maps JavaScript API. This API is specifically designed to be lightweight and modular; accordingly, it did not originally contain the built-in KML support of Version 2. This library was originally intended to fill that need; as KML support has been added natively in Version 3, it now allows access to individual markers, polylines and polygons, rendered from KML.

Original code inspired by Mike Williams' EGeoXml object (http://econym.org.uk/gmap/egeoxml.htm).
